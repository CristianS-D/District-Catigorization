    "What am I hoping clustering will do?\n",
    "- Make more \"like\" groupings of school districts based on certain demographic data. \n",
    "- I believe the clusters will still have normal distribution curves, and linear relationships.\n",

    "What columns are allowed in clustering -- For this one I want to make two selection types, one with ethnic data and one without as some grants or other funding does not like considering that information when grouping\n",

    "What makes up a row?\n",
    "- a row will be made up of one school with all of its given metrics\n",
    "- I want to only select schools who's metrics have not drastically changed in the past 3 years. What is why I have the historical data as I believe if a school has hd drastic changes they will be an outlier and throw off the model. for the school years data I will want to use the 2024 numbers as I believe any miss calculations have been adjusted by then (not sure if they even upload corrections but don't feel like looking as of now).\n",
    "- I will need to normalize all the numbers down to aq 0 to 1 scale so large differences aren't causing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also like to run an algo to see how strongly any one variable seems to be in relation to the overall outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, my data probably looks like a few loosely clouds semi clustered and overlapping because nothing is normalized and teacher pay of $40,000 and eco-dis count of 270 out of 3000 students are working together to make the a shape but are working on completely different scales, so I need an approach that with a very loss clustering algo until I clean further."
